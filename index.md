## How do computers translate to 1s and 0s

The video was ok but wasn't as good as the guy with the fancy scarf! this is i feel like good background knowledge to know, while it may not immedietly  help with your current skills it is important to at least have some kind of notion of what is going on in the background.

**fun Fact: We named our xbox one in binary code so when you search on wifi for it shows as "01111000011000100110111101111000" haha**

*What is a string?*
Strings are characters contained inside single ('') or double ("") quotation marks.
// Using `""` - double quotation marks

"Mamino";

// Using `''` - single quotation marks
'Mamino'

*What is a number?*
Numbers are any numbers not contained in quotation marks.

`15;
5;
0.5;`

*What are booleans?*
True or false statements

`// Declare a boolean variable
let isJavaScriptFun = true;

// Use the boolean variable in a conditional statement
if (isJavaScriptFun) {
    console.log("JavaScript is fun!");
} else {
    console.log("JavaScript is not fun.");
}`

*What is a variable?*
Variables are used rto store values of some type, there are also special values such as const and let  you  assign something to a variable using the "=" symbol.

*What is a operator?*
An operator is something that does soemthing, the more comon are the maths operators such as "+" "-" "*" there is also the "&&" where if both conditions are true it performs something and the "||" where if one of the conditions are true. along with the "!" returns true if the operand is false and false if its true.

*What is a Template Literals?*

This is the first class this has been introduced to me in but i have seen it in the past. it is another way to at least do string concatenation without the "+" doing something you might not want it to i feel like using temperate literal is much better practice to avoid any dumb mistake.
